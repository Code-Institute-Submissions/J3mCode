## Introduction

  Hello, and welcome to a brief introduction for Jacqueline Marquez, science and tech professional, with extensive experience. Under the ever constant goal to continually improve and become more efficient, Jacqui has challenged herself with constant learning and developement of industry skills and strengths.
  This site will act as a brief tour of Jacqui's experience, and a great way to review her expertise. 

UX
--------------------------

  The design of this site is tailored to Jacqui's own asthetic, simple, clear, and static. 
  The purpose of this exercise is to display my current skill set and show that I am active and employable.
  The site may be accessed by employers or recruiters and was designed with the goal of simplicity and succinctness.
  
  Strategy-
  To show employability, I focused the site on my previous experience and by creating specific elements to watch my progress and practice.
  It was inportant that there was consistency in the format of this site and based on user research it implements elements of B2B design through expected actions.
  
  Scope-
  It was important to incorperate as much career experience and to demonstrate my interest in the field of Data science.
  To do this I made much if the information based on resume items to past experience and current progress. Part of the reasoning is to highlight my activeness in data science.
  
  Structure-
  The structure was implemented through careful considerations to the elements that would be included in the site.
  The landing page was aimed to portray a brief intro to which users could get basic highlighted background and skills.
  The original Idea was to create a left to right structure. Upon review, the elements seemed to be in competition so to better balance the page,
  all elements were centered and made more cohesive.

A secondary page with higher importance was presenting a resume page. This was placed as the second page for consideration that this may be a page
most employers would navigate to with high priority and within a short time of accessing the site. It was always an idea to have a pdf downloadable
link on this page, but by utilizing a iframe, there could be a viewable window for my resume as well as the download feature. 
By utilizing a timeline, A brief history of goals could accompant the resume page for brief progress for those users which did not want to look through the pdf.

 The final page is a portfolio page to include previous projects and current working projects.
 I wanted a simple format with basic information so that if employers were curios to know more they could always reach out.
 Showing the page links to working projects and praticing links will show my current progress and skill level within certain challeges.

Maintaining the size of the elements while also making each pages contents pushed into a one scoll page.

BUGS

Some of the main user errors were the iframer viewer connection for the resume page.
For a while there was a connection error but this was resolved by usingin a different soorce url to host the pdf file.

An additional common error was the elements positioning. Occasionally the margins would push elements to the left or right of the screen
This also made the translatability between desktop and mobile versions alter the image positions.
Images would be fixed to a certain size and go past the margin of certain mobile devices.

By centering all elements, and maintaining a certain size boundary, the elements could remain in the center even while changing browser sizes.
To also fix the images error, the width element was changed from a fixed value to a responsive value that would keep the image a certain size,
and placement, but also editits size when changing to a different mobile device

Deployment
--------------------------

To deploy my webpage, I used Github platform and the Gitpod workspaces. Through workspaces I would add files such as images or pdfs to use on
 the website and could edit individual files.
To access gitpod first a developer would have to visit my page repository at: https://github.com/J3mCode/J3mCode.github.io
The repository has a button on the top of the commits which links to Gitpod workspaces.

Once gitpod workspaces loads, a current workspace will be open with links to each uploaded file to the left.
 Images contained from the main page and additional website pages are located in the CSS > images file. All of these images are deployed within
  the live site. All other images contained for the readme were stored in the wireframe file.

  From workspaces I drafted html files for each website page (home, resume and portfolio) and additionally created css pages for the individuals stylings.
  Each page has unique stylings for the individual needs of each page.
