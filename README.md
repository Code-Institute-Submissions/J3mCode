## Introduction

  Hello, and welcome to a brief introduction for Jacqueline Marquez, science and tech professional, with extensive experience. Under the ever constant goal to continually improve and become more efficient, Jacqui has challenged herself with constant learning and developement of industry skills and strengths.
  This site will act as a brief tour of Jacqui's experience, and a great way to review her expertise. 

UX
--------------------------

  The design of this site is tailored to Jacqui's own asthetic, simple, clear, and static. 
  The purpose of this exercise is to display my current skill set and show that I am active and employable.
  The site may be accessed by employers or recruiters and was designed with the goal of simplicity and succinctness.
  
  Strategy-
  To show employability, I focused the site on my previous experience and by creating specific elements to watch my progress and practice.
  It was inportant that there was consistency in the format of this site and based on user research it implements elements of B2B design through expected actions.
  
  Scope-
  It was important to incorperate as much career experience and to demonstrate my interest in the field of Data science.
  To do this I made much if the information based on resume items to past experience and current progress. Part of the reasoning is to highlight my activeness in data science.
  
  Structure-
  The structure was implemented through careful considerations to the elements that would be included in the site.
  The landing page was aimed to portray a brief intro to which users could get basic highlighted background and skills.
  The original Idea was to create a left to right structure. Upon review, the elements seemed to be in competition so to better balance the page,
  all elements were centered and made more cohesive.

A secondary page with higher importance was presenting a resume page. This was placed as the second page for consideration that this may be a page
most employers would navigate to with high priority and within a short time of accessing the site. It was always an idea to have a pdf downloadable
link on this page, but by utilizing a iframe, there could be a viewable window for my resume as well as the download feature. 
By utilizing a timeline, A brief history of goals could accompant the resume page for brief progress for those users which did not want to look through the pdf.

 The final page is a portfolio page to include previous projects and current working projects.
 I wanted a simple format with basic information so that if employers were curios to know more they could always reach out.
 Showing the page links to working projects and praticing links will show my current progress and skill level within certain challeges.
