UX
--------------------------

  The design of this site is tailored to Jacqui's own asthetic, simple, clear, and static. 
  The purpose of this exercise is to display my current skill set and show that I am active and employable.
  The site may be accessed by employers or recruiters and was designed with the goal of simplicity and succinctness.
  
  Strategy-
  To show employability, I focused the site on my previous experience and by creating specific elements to watch my progress and practice.
  It was inportant that there was consistency in the format of this site and based on user research it implements elements of B2B design through expected actions.
  
  Scope-
  It was important to incorperate as much career experience and to demonstrate my interest in the field of Data science.
  To do this I made much if the information based on resume items to past experience and current progress. Part of the reasoning is to highlight my activeness in data science.
  
  Structure-
  The structure was implemented through careful considerations to the elements that would be included in the site.
  The landing page was aimed to portray a brief intro to which users could get basic highlighted background and skills.
  The original Idea was to create a left to right structure. Upon review, the elements seemed to be in competition so to better balance the page,
  all elements were centered and made more cohesive.
