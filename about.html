    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Jacqui was not always working in the technology field, but she did always have a hunger for knowledge.
    Thoughout her High School days, she spent most of her time engrossed in AP Biology books and watching animal planet or discovery channel.
    She was the first in her family to dream of college, as she is a first generation american, and the first 
    to be able to accomplish admission.</p>
    <p>She applied to her dream college, Colorado State University (CSU), as a Biology degree while participating in extra curricular clubs and activities,
    such as, the Associated Students of CSU (the student body government), the Wildlife Restoration Club, and
    the Society for Conservation Biology. </p>
